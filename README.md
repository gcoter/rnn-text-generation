# RNN Text Generation
## Description
I try to implement a RNN to generate text, based on ALICEâ€™S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND.

This project is inspired from a tutorial (see references) which showed how to use LSTM for text generation with Keras.

I decided to reimplement it with Tensorflow, as an exercise.

## Usage
There are two main tasks:

* Type `python rnn-text-generation.py train` to start training with default parameters
* Type `python rnn-text-generation.py generate` to start text generation with default parameters

All default parameters are defined in constants.py. You can provide any of those parameters (except UNKNOWN_CHARS) directly in the command line. Type `python rnn-text-generation.py -h`, `python rnn-text-generation.py train -h` or `python rnn-text-generation.py generate -h` for more information.
