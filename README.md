# RNN Text Generation
## Description
I try to implement a RNN to generate text, based on ALICEâ€™S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND.

This project is inspired from a tutorial (see references) which showed how to use LSTM for text generation with Keras.

I decided to reimplement it with Tensorflow, as an exercise.

The current version seems to work, however it takes too much time with my CPU (30 minutes per epoch). I will run it soon on another machine with GPU.
